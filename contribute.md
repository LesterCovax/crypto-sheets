# Crypto Sheets Contribution Guidelines

This script is aimed at being user friendly, with the eventual goal of users not having to edit the script at all.  Please check the open issues and add new ones for additional features or bugs.

## This project utilizes GitFlow

Please create new feature branches for new functionality.  These branches will then be merged into the `develop` branch for further testing and review until packaged into a new `release` and merged back into `master`.

For general GitFlow guidelines and best practices, please consult [Atlassian's GitFlow Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

## Reddit

Please promote the use of our subreddit for user help.  If you're a contributor to the project, feel free to request moderator privileges.  Users should also be encouraged to create GitHub issues, or create issues based on commonly seen issues.
